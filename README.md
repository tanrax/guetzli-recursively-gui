# Guetzli-R
Guetzli is a Google program to optimize JPEG images. Unfortunately, it only works one file at a time. With Guetzli-R, this GUI, you can do it recursively a whole folder. If you just want to run it by terminal you should go to [guetzli-recursively](https://github.com/tanrax/guetzli-recursively)
